Hey everyone, so recently I've been pretty busy on GitHub. I opened up a few projects that I've been pushing to at least every day. The one I'm having a lot of fun making is called 'RCEconomy'. It's an economy library for Cocoa games. Usually ones with in-game economies, like RPGs. What it does is makes the in-game money handling easier. I'm adding support for having player bank accounts, ATMs (optional), player pocket cash, etc. I plan on adding custom currencies too, so people could tweak my library to their liking. So far I've built maybe 1/3 of the player pocket cash part. On the other hand, I still have to work on the documentation a bit more. So if you have time, drop by the [repo](http://github.com/imryan/rceconomy) check it out, and maybe contribute! Any help is appreciated! Also, I plan on recreating the same library for iOS RPG games as well in the near-future. Thanks for reading, have a great day!
