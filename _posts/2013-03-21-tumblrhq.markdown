Tumblr headquarters is most-likely one of the coolest startup offices ever. Even though this is really the only one I’ve been to, it’s still awesome. They have two floors, with two sides each. On one floor, the developers have one side, and the designers have the other. The floors are divided by a stairwell (sort of) and a small hallway between, where there’s an elevator. I don’t think I saw a single PC the whole time. The whole office is basically Apple Thunderbolt displays. It was beautiful. Everyone there has great style, and an awesome personality. They all seem to love what they do; and it makes me happy knowing that. Also, in the main lobby, they had really comfy chairs with a wooden coffee table. On the table there was a book titled “tumblr - theme directory”. It was just an awesome experience.
