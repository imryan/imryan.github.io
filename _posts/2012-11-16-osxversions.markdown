I think about this quite frequently, so I thought I’d share it with everyone. I’m sure everyone misses something, doesn’t have to be anything in particular. Just anything, in general. Well, me being the computer enthusiast, I often find myself having nostalgic thoughts about previous OS X versions I’ve worked on. To begin, I’ll start off by saying that Mountain Lion is a beautiful piece of a software update, but in my opinion, Snow Leopard was much more stable. Here’s why:

Snow Leopard needed minimum requirements to be met in order to run efficiently, like:

- An Intel processor
- 1GB of memory
- 5GB of available disk space
- DVD drive for installation

If that may seem like a lot to ask for, then you must still be running on a Commodore 64. My main point is that Mac OS X 10.6 was very fast, while only using an acute amount of your * computer’s existing resources. In Snow Leopard, many great built-in applications were added, such as:

- Time Machine – for storing data in a Time Capsule.
- Photo Booth – so the teen girls in the Apple store are happy.
- Screen Sharing – also active in iChat
- Boot Camp – for running most Windows operating systems on the Mac.
- DVD Player – title says all.
- iChat – for those who don’t know, http://bit.ly/yHeZZ.
- QuickTime X movie capture – records video from iSight webcam.

Many more graphics improvements and developer tools.
If you catch my drift now, most of the base features that are currently implemented in OS X, were first introduced in 10.6 and lower. Most of these applications have been way updated, and have some positives and negatives.

Now in OS X Mountain Lion…Oh, what a change. It’s like going from the year 2000 to 2020 in just a few version updates. Here’s Mountain Lion’s requirements:

- OS X 10.6.8 or later
- 2GB of memory
- 8GB of free space
- Supported Mac models:
- iMac – mid 2007 or newer.
- MacBook – late 2008 alum. or early 2009, or newer.
- MacBook Pro – mid/late 2007 or newer.
- MacBook Air – late 2008 or newer.
- Mac mini – early 2009 or newer.
- Mac Pro – early 2008 or newer.
- Xserve – early 2009 (if anyone really uses this.)

Most applications in which I previously discussed above, have mainly been changed, none removed, that I know of. Few applications were also added, along with an almost exact interface change to resemble the iOS operating system on Apple’s mobile devices. If you own a Mac from the list I stated above, you most likely are running Mountain Lion! Even on newer computers, I still feel it lacks certain efficiencies it should have from the start. More importantly to me, I still favor Snow Leopard’s beautiful interface much more than these new tiny stop-light buttons we were given now.
