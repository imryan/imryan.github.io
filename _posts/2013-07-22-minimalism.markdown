I see many people who are recently converting to to a more minimalistic way of life. This can be done by seeing things less complicatedly, doing things more logically, or even decorating or dressing more simply. Most of my life, I’ve seen people live over-complicatedly, and become easily stressed out. But what they don’t know is that to ease that stress, or to even get rid of it, the key is to live minimally. If you’re busy at work, a messy workspace is one of the main key factors to become a distraction. One of my many methods to living more simply, is to be tidy. Get rid of what you don’t necessarily need, or things you don’t want anymore too. You’ll notice that the area is much more peaceful and easier to operate in. Next, it is always good to think more logically. As a programmer, problem solving is something I tend to do many times per day, and I’ve thought of a few ways to break down the issue. What I use to think more logically is to create a mental outline of the problem and link ways together to reach a solution. I’m sure many others use this approach as well as I, and it is a great practice to accustom yourself to.
