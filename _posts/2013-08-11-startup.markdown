Since about July, I've been on and off working with an awesome team of enthusiastic developers on their new startup. I can't say much about it yet, but once it's hit the public, I could go on and on. It's an awesome idea, really. It's something that I'm surprised isn't a thing already. I can give a hint: it is a social network-type application. We've began working on the site landing page, as well as the Android and iOS app. The team behind it all is just awesome. Their enthusiasm in their bright idea really reflects a lot on them, and I can truly see this going somewhere. I've been asked to assist in the building of the iOS client, and I couldn't be more excited than I already am. This is my first opportunity to work in a team setting, and on a product that will really change the way people do things. More updates to come, including a subtle development log and possibly some early previews. Stay tuned viewers, something big is in the making.
