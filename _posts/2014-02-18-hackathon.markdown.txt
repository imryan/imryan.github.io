Wow, haven't posted anything here in some time. But the good news isÂ that I have been very busy, and have a lot of neat things to log down here.

First off, I've been doing a lot of web stuff recently, such as Node, Rails, Sinatra, etc. I learned how to write some simple REST APIs, which got me pretty excited and more into web development. Needless to say, I'm still doing iOS stuff, but I initially began web backend things in order to build an iOS app I'm currently working on. But anyway, onto the actual topic.

Early this month I found out about CodeDay, after searching around on reddit a bit. It's a 24 hour hackathon aimed at students that was based in Manhattan. So, I signed up the next day, and ended up going to it last weekend. I had a great time, and met some really awesome kids about the same age as me. I took the bus into the Port Authority bus terminal, rode the subway downtown, and began my journey at my first ever hackathon.
