  <h1>My Story</h1>    
  <p>
  Hello world, my name is Ryan Cohen. I'm 17 years old, and I'm passionate about technology. We use it everyday,
  whether it's unlocking a car, using a computer, or even using a cell phone. Behind all of these great things, there
  are people who dedicate their lives to revolutionizing the way we do things. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't
  have computers, cell phones, game consoles or anything. When I first picked up a piece of technology at a
  young age, I remember wondering how it internally worked. I wanted to know what was under the hood; how it all came
  together in unison to function. On Christmas Day 2008, my life changed forever. I received an iPod touch, and if it 
  wasn't for that, I wouldn't be where I am today. I began downloading app after app after app. That's when I
  wondered to myself; "I wonder how these are made..." That's when I found Objective-C. The programming language that
  made it all possible. In September of 2009, I then received my first computer; a 20-inch iMac. The most beautiful 
  thing I have ever laid my eyes on. From there on, I started building simple programs and web browsers in Xcode. It 
  wasn't until June of 2011 when I built and published my very first title "CanSmash." A game where you had to crush
  all the cans on the screen within the given time amount. When you were done, you could post your scores on Twitter,
  and challenge your friends. I was so proud of what I had built with my own imagination. A year later, I removed
  the app from sales. I then released a sequel called "BitHero," with the same concept as CanSmash. Since then, I've
  been learning more and more, and increasing my capabilities day by day.
