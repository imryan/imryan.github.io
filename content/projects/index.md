The iOS application that better helps display PATH train times in a fast and feature-packed way. Built with my friend [Avi](https://avijeets.com).

## [Walkmore](https://github.com/learn-co-students/ios-0616-team-whale) 🚶‍♂️
This project is aimed at helping users to be more active. Walkmore will help a user plan a day trip. Walkmore helps its users create a walking path. The path a user take will ultimately get the user from point A to point B, but it will take the user by historic landmarks (of the user's choosing) that are along the way. Built at Flatiron School in 2016.
