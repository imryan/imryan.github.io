I've been developing for iOS since early 2011 and these are some things I've created during that time. (More like in the last two years since my design taste has actually evolved. I won't lie to you.)

### Quo
Quo was an app built at CodeDay NYC in 2014 which was held at [The Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/campuses/nyc/), ironically enough where I attend now. The purpose of Quo was to provide a modern platform for creative thought. To describe it in summary, it was a social creative platform. Users could write posts and submit them, where they would later be viewed and liked by other readers. It won the best app award at the hackathon. My friend [Phil](http://fishbe.in) and I had a great time building it.

### Datakick iOS
I wrote an Objective-C API wrapper for the [Datakick](http://datakick.org) service. Datakick is an open product database containing thousands of UPC codes. You can find my repo [here.](http://github.com/imryan/datakick-ios)

### SubwayIcons
After working with the [FontAwesomeKit](http://github.com/PrideChung/FontAwesomeKit) library, I was inspired to make some of my own additions to it. I needed NYC subway icons for a school project, so I made a hacky extension of FAK to do just that. You can find my repo [here.](http://github.com/imryan/subwayicons)

### Hemingway

### Dormsnap
